            <h3 class="title">The Birth : Krishna Janmashtami</h3>
            <p class="text">In the Yadu Dynasty, the king of Mathura – Kansa – was a cruel king. It was foretold that his sister Devaki would bear the child that would defeat Kansa. Enraged and fearful, Kansa killed each and every child that Devaki bore. When Krishna, the eighth child, was born, he was smuggled outside the palace and across the Yamuna and given to his foster parents – Nanda and Yashoda. The young child of Nanda and Yashoda was carried back, in Krishna’s place, and killed by Kansa. The infant ascended to heaven, transforming into a goddess who informed Kansa that his time was to come soon.Years later, Krishna returned and killed Kansa – the embodiment of cruelty and evil.</p>

            <h3 class="title">One God, Countless Celebrations - North India</h3>
            <p class="text">The kingdom of (Mathura) Krishna's birthplace, and Vrindavan (where he grew up) are found in one of India's largest states – Uttar Pradesh. In Vrindavan, celebrations begin 10 days before the actual day. Rasleelas and plays based on the events of Krishna’s life are performed. Temples and homes are decorated with pomp and splendour, and the “abhishek” – the bathing of the idol before the celebrations, is a massive event. In Mathura, the two most important aspects of the festival are celebrated with fervour. The first being Jhulanotsov, where locals place swings in their courtyards (to symbolise baby Krishna’s cradle) and decorate temples with flowers and rangolis to welcome Krishna. The second celebration is Ghatas – where all temples are decorated with a particular thematic colour. The main events are held at the location of Krishna’s birth, which was converted into the Krishna Janma Bhoomi Mandir.Other parts of North India, like Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himalayan North celebrate Janmashtami with equal splendour.</p>

            <h3 class="title">South India : Krishna Janmashtami Celebration</h3>
            <p class="text">In South India, Gokula Ashtami, is celebrated with great devotion. Kolams (intricate patterns drawn with rice powder) are traced on the floor. Geetha Govindam is sung in praise of Krishna and butter, beetel leaves and fruits are offered. In Andhra Pradesh, young boys are dressed like Krishna and visit neighbours and friends. Rajagopalaswamy temple, Pandavadhoothar temple, Sri Krishna temple and the Krishna temple in Guruvayur all conduct grand Janmashtami celebrations in the South.</p>
            <p class="text">Other countries like Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Jamaica all celebrate Janmashtami, so if you’re in the area, don’t worry about missing out on the festivities. If you’re intrigued by these celebrations or want to travel to a different city to celebrate Janmashtami, you can book a holiday, your tickets or your accommodation with Thomas Cook.</p>
